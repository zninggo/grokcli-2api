"""Browser-fingerprint transport layer for xconsole_client.

Why: the x.ai endpoints sit behind Cloudflare and are sensitive to TLS / HTTP2 /
header-order fingerprints. A bare `urllib` request will get a 403 with
`cf-mitigated: challenge` on most paths. This module wraps `curl_cffi`, which
performs TLS+HTTP2+header-order impersonation of a real browser at the libcurl
level (no headless browser required), and lets us match the captured Chrome
148 / Windows fingerprint.

The default impersonate target is `chrome131` (closest stable preset available
in `curl_cffi 0.15.0`). The visible User-Agent and most other surface headers
still come from `xconsole_client.config` so they stay exactly consistent with
the original capture.

You can swap to `urllib` (no fingerprint) by setting
`XConsoleAuthClient(transport="urllib")` for offline code-only tests, but
against the real `accounts.x.ai` you'll almost certainly be challenged.
